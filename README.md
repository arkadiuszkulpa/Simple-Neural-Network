Hi,
In this project I wanted to understand better how neural networks work. I did not want to use Keras or anything that simplifies the steps but also obscures them.
Instead I wanted to use 'pure' python with some helper libraries like numpy and pandas, but showing all the steps so my brain can comprehend how the neural network actually achieves the feat of learning.
